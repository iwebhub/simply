A simple PHP "router"! :D


Simply is built for people who just *code*.
If you've been putting different pages into different .php files, you can move to simply in a few minutes.

All files are files. Everything you've coded out works. No additional classes to use. Nothing to worry about. Simple makes pretty URLs easy.

This doesn't follow architectures that some routers follow, this just makes the URLs your app uses pretty.

Config
=====
Put the paths to your files into routes.php.

Put a $path variable to routes.php or somewhere else that's accessible to simply. If the URL to your app is 'http://localhost/simply/', $path = '/simply'. If the URL to your app is 'http://localhost/', $path = '/'. I think you get the point.

Put the simply.php to index.php.

Put the htaccess.txt in your .htaccess file.



**That's it! You're using the ultrasimple PHP router.**
